Over the past few weeks, I have delved into the capabilities of Apache Airflow, specifically exploring its potential for running parallel tasks and optimizing task execution by transitioning from the default SequentialExecutor to the LocalExecutor. Through this exploration, I have identified significant opportunities for improving our project's efficiency and performance.

Considering the scalability requirements and the growing complexity of our project tasks, I am excited to propose a strategic move towards Kubernetes cluster orchestration. Kubernetes offers a robust and scalable solution that aligns seamlessly with our project's evolving needs
