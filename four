I am pleased to report that all the tasks related to these projects have been successfully completed. From the initiation to the execution phase, I have focused on maintaining high-quality standards and ensuring that all deliverables were met within the specified timelines. The implemented solutions are currently operational and running smoothly.

Throughout the development process, I have paid meticulous attention to detail to ensure that the code is robust, efficient, and adheres to best practices. The use of Apache Spark and Apache Airflow has proven to be instrumental in achieving the project goals, and the integration of these technologies has significantly enhanced the overall productivity of our workflows.
