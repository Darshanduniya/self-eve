Over the past year, I dedicated myself to expanding my knowledge and skills in the field of cloud computing and database management.

I am pleased to inform you that I have successfully completed the AWS Cloud Practitioner Certification exam, a significant achievement that reflects my commitment to mastering the fundamentals of cloud technology. The certification has not only deepened my understanding of AWS but has also equipped me with the skills to navigate and utilize cloud services effectively.

Additionally, I delved into the intricacies of white box database management throughout the year. This learning experience has provided me with valuable insights into the inner workings of databases, enabling me to optimize their performance and security.
